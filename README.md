# EntrepriseLLM

Welcome to EntrepriseLLM, a high-performance chatbot designed for deployment in large-scale environments. This chatbot is not only optimized for scalability and efficiency but also ensures privacy compliance, giving you full control over your data. It's currently configured to integrate with the Azure Cloud suite, including Cosmos DB, a NoSQL database, and Azure ML Online REST endpoints, but can of course be implemented with other databases and REST endpoints for model hosting. This adaptable setup enables easy scalability and efficient management of a wide range of models, such as Mistral AI, Llama2, and more, making EntrepriseLLM an ideal solution for robust, secure, and dynamic chatbot applications.
